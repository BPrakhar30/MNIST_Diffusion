**MNIST Diffusion Model for Image Generation**

This repository contains an implementation of a diffusion model for generating images, specifically focusing on the MNIST dataset. This model exemplifies the generation of digit images using a novel approach based on diffusion processes.

**Features of the Implementation**

**Data Loader for MNIST Dataset**

Custom Data Loader: Function create\_mnist\_dataloaders is defined for loading the MNIST dataset with preprocessing steps including resizing, tensor conversion, and normalization.

Data Subset Selection: The loader selects a subset of the MNIST dataset (first 5000 instances of digit '1') for training, which allows focused learning on a specific digit.

**Diffusion Model Architecture**

MNIST Diffusion Class: The MNISTDiffusion class is a PyTorch nn.Module that implements a diffusion model, a type of generative model that gradually adds noise to an image and learns to reverse this process.

Cosine Variance Schedule: Implements a cosine variance schedule to control the noise level during the diffusion process.

UNet Architecture: Utilizes a UNet-like architecture for the diffusion model, enabling efficient learning of the noising and denoising steps.

**Training and Generation Process**

Training Loop: Includes a training loop for the diffusion model with MSE loss and AdamW optimizer, alongside a learning rate scheduler.

Image Sampling: The sampling method in the MNISTDiffusion class generates digit images by reversing the diffusion process, starting from random noise.

Visualization: Provides visualization scripts for the generated images at different stages of the denoising process.

**Conclusion**

This diffusion model demonstrates an advanced technique in generative modeling, specifically tailored for image generation tasks. The implementation focuses on learning to generate digit images from the MNIST dataset, providing a unique perspective on leveraging diffusion processes in neural network-based image generation.
